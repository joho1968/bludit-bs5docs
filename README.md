# bs5docs Theme for Bludit

bs5docs is a Bootstrap 5 theme for Bludit

## Description

BS5Docs is a Bootstrap 5.3.x theme for Bludit. It serves Bootstrap locally and does not use Bludit's included Bootstrap.

The intended use case is to create online documentation.

It is, to some extent, inspired by the Bootstrap 5 documentation site, as well as the Bludit DocX theme.

The theme is responsive, multi-device friendly, and supports light and dark mode automatically. It should also play nicely with screen readers (ARIA) and similar devices.

* automatic detection of light and dark mode, as configured in the browser
* **sidebar**; sidebar content will be displayed on the **MORE** menu
* **social media links**; social media links will be displayed on **MORE** menu
* **RSS feed**; the RSS link will be displayed on **MORE** menu
* **static pages** and **static sub pages**; these are used to create your online documentation
* **regular pages** and **sticky pages** are displayed in the "home" context
* **homepage** can be set as the start of your documentation, or empty for a blog like starting point
* **page description**, **site slogan**, and **site description**
* **pagenotfound**
* **footer**, if configured in Bludit, will be displayed in the left navigation bar and on the off-canvas menu
* browsing by tag
* **searching for content**; the search box will be displayed on **MORE** menu if enabled in Bludit
* **date format** automatically take the configured locale into account
* no icon kit is used, instead the theme uses Emoji where needed

_The theme contains no tracking code of any kind, nor does it load any external resources_
